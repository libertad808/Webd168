          Hi My name is Marisol Alvarez,I am a 34 year old cat lady, who loves
          outdoor adventures and learning about new cultures. I decided to go
          back to school and learn how to develop websites because I enjoy being
          creative and have always wanted to learn web design. I already have a
          business degree so I believe I will be able to excel once I learn and
          practice my coding. At the moment I still struggle with coding, this
          is only my second coding course but I do enjoy learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          By taking this course I hope to continue practicing and learning how
          to better code to make usable and appealing websites. I am hoping to
          be equipped enough to create websites for my small business and to do
          websites as a freelance career.I want to be able to use my creativity
          to help mostly small business in expanding their businesses. Websites
          are essential for all who have a product or service they offer. I want
          to be able to give different scale offerings so more entrepreneurs can
          afford to build a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not studying or working, I enjoy spending time in nature and
          in the kitchen. I also enjoy traveling with friends and learning about
          new cultures. I am a very family oriented person who loved hosting
          dinner parties.
        </p>
